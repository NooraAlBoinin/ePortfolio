 <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
                    <p>After completing this module, I now have a better understanding of machine learning from both a theoretical and practical perspective. Before this class, I had a general idea of what machine learning was, but I lacked a deeper understanding of how different methods worked or how to implement them. Throughout this course, I have learned about the structure and function of various machine learning models and the ethical, social, and professional responsibilities that come with using these models in real-world applications. The hands-on exercises provided insights into how the Fourth Industrial Revolution is reshaping the future of industries. Technologies like AI and machine learning play a critical role in this transformation (Schwab and Zahid, 2020). I was particularly drawn to discussions around AI bias and privacy concerns, which I explored further through case studies like the Boeing 737 Max disaster, where flawed automated systems led to disastrous outcomes. This case made me think critically about the need for careful ethical evaluation of machine learning models, especially in fields that directly impact human lives (Wall, 2019).
 <br>
A significant focus of the module was learning how to use machine learning methods like Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Before this module, I was unfamiliar with these models, and I found it fascinating to learn how CNNs mimic biological neural networks. In the Unit 6 project, we applied CNNs to the CIFAR-10 dataset for image classification. This involved setting up convolutional layers, pooling layers, and backpropagation—each crucial for optimizing the model’s performance. Although I had some prior knowledge of regression models and clustering, this was my first time working with neural networks. It took some time to become proficient, but the experience was valuable. I quickly learned that hyperparameter tuning greatly influences model performance, and by experimenting with different learning rates and epochs, I was able to improve our model's accuracy (Miroslav, 2021). This hands-on experience solidified the theoretical concepts discussed in class and boosted my confidence in working with complex machine learning models.
 <br>
The module also placed a strong emphasis on teamwork and collaboration, which was a new challenge for me. Working in a distributed team presented difficulties in time management and communication, especially given the different time zones we were in. During the Unit 11 project, which focused on model evaluation, we had to work closely to divide tasks and ensure we were aligned. I was responsible for implementing the model evaluation metrics, such as AUC and R², and also took the lead in organizing team meetings. These experiences helped me improve my project management and leadership skills, especially in coordinating across time zones. Feedback from my peers on my contributions was positive, highlighting areas where I had grown, particularly in communication and collaboration.
 <br>
However, the module also presented some challenges. Understanding metrics like AUC and R² for evaluating model performance was difficult. While I recognize the importance of these metrics in selecting and optimizing models, I still find them somewhat challenging to grasp and plan to study them further in my own time. Balancing my individual tasks with team responsibilities was also challenging, particularly when assignments overlapped. However, these challenges taught me important lessons about time management and prioritization that I will apply in future projects. Another major challenge was grappling with the ethical issues surrounding AI, particularly in healthcare. Discussions about bias in AI systems and the need for transparency in machine learning models made me think critically about the potential for these technologies to both help and harm. I learned that biased training data can lead to unfair outcomes, which has made me more cautious about the datasets I will use in future projects (Rolfe et al., 2001).
 <br>
Looking ahead, I plan to apply the machine learning techniques I have learned to more complex datasets and projects. I am particularly interested in unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning, as they hold significant potential for real-time data analysis in sectors like healthcare and finance. Additionally, I aim to further improve my skills in model selection and evaluation, as this is an area where I believe I can improve. The teamwork skills I have developed will also serve me well in future collaborative projects. I now recognize the importance of clear and consistent communication and plan to use tools like Trello or Slack to better manage tasks and ensure team alignment. This module has also left a lasting impact on my understanding of the ethical responsibilities of machine learning professionals. Moving forward, I will prioritize fairness, transparency, and data security in all of my projects, ensuring that my models are not only technically sound but also ethically responsible.
 <br>
In conclusion, this module has helped me develop both my technical and professional skills. From learning about cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to reflecting on the ethical responsibilities of AI, I feel better equipped to navigate the challenges of this field. The knowledge and skills I have gained will undoubtedly play a key role in my future career, and I am eager to apply them in real-world settings.
