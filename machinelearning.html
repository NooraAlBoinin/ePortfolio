                    <h2>Unit 1: Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)</h2>
                    <p>This unit has defined what machine learning (ML) is and why it is relevant in today’s business and industry. I learned that big data and ML algorithms are used in self-driving banking and online recommendations. The topic covered the background of ML, its uses, and the potential of the technology particularly in Industry 4.0. Another key finding was the integration of big data, ML, and AI to enhance automation and decision making (Zhao and Li, 2018). For the proper use of ML, the following ethical questions must be answered: bias in decision making, and data privacy (Schwab and Zahid, 2020). I learned programming, statistics, and critical thinking because ML involves technical skills and ethical understanding. The unit concluded by revisiting some of the ML issues such as overfitting and bias and how to address them through data management, algorithm training, and model assessment (Miroslav, 2021). This subject helped me build a strong foundation for my future courses in ML and equipped me to face the challenges and opportunities of the field.</p>

                    <h2>Unit 2: Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
                    <p>In Unit 2, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was presented, and it was stressed that EDA is crucial for checking the reliability of data used in data science and AI projects. EDA is useful in confirming the quality of raw data, identifying inconsistencies, and identifying patterns that might not be easily recognizable to the stakeholders or data analysts. It is very useful in feature selection for machine learning models because the initial set of features may require modification after the analysis of the data set. The unit discussed the process of EDA including how to explore the features of the data, detect outliers, and visualize the data. At the end of this unit, the learner should be able to conduct basic EDA, preprocess data for machine learning, and appreciate the role of EDA in feature engineering for both supervised and unsupervised learning models (Miroslav, 2021).</p>

                    <h2>Unit 3: Correlation and Regression</h2>
                    <p>In Unit 3, I learnt how to use different association and regression methods in the real world. These included simple regression, multiple regression, and polynomial regression. Using these methods is the only way to guess how two variables will relate to each other, like how age and income affect each other.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong> I got a good grasp on how to use correlation and regression analysis on different sets of data to guess how factors will relate to each other.
I learnt how to talk about the professional, social, moral, and legal problems that come up in machine learning, especially when using datasets that could affect decisions in the real world.
I learnt about the difficulties of using machine learning methods on various datasets and how important it is to pick the right datasets and prepare them properly.

                    <p>In Unit 4, I learned to apply linear regression using the Scikit-Learn library. This included modeling both simple and multivariate linear relationships, as well as evaluating model effectiveness through metrics such as R-squared. The unit emphasized handling complex datasets and optimizing models for better accuracy.
</p>
<strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong> Regression Modelling with Big Datasets: By the end of the unit, I knew how to use both simple and multivariate regression methods to do regression modelling for even the most difficult datasets.
Testing and Improving Models: I learnt how to test regression models and improve them so they work better by optimising them.
Skills in Scikit-Learn: I learnt more about the Scikit-Learn library, which is a key part of Python projects that use machine learning. For the planning process to go faster, I learnt how to use its many tools.

                    <h2>Unit 5: Clustering</h2>
                    <p>Within Unit 5, I learnt about cluster analysis, which puts things into groups based on how related they are. Pattern recognition, image analysis, bioinformatics, and machine learning are just a few of the areas that use this method. The basics of clustering, different ways to measure distance, and well-known clustering methods like K-means and agglomerative clustering are some of the main themes covered. I also looked into how to judge the quality of groups.

</p>
                    <strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong> Realised the basic ideas behind grouping.
I learnt how to use and evaluate K-means and other clustering methods.
Recognised the problems and risks that could come up with grouping methods.

                    <h2>Unit 6: Clustering with Python</h2>
                    <p>This week, we will use Python's scikit-learn library to apply the K-means clustering method to real-world datasets. This week builds on last week's introduction to clustering by talking about how clustering analysis can be used in real life. Some of the most important topics are how Python libraries can be used in K-means clustering and how clustering methods can help solve hard problems in big datasets. Learners will use scikit-learn to do clustering analysis, choose the right tools, and look at the results to figure out what they mean.

K-means clustering is a way to use machine learning to put data points into groups based on how they are similar or how they repeat. It's easier to use K-means on real-world data because Python's scikit-learn library makes it easier to implement by giving you a lot of tools (Miroslav, 2021). This week focusses on the basic skills that are needed to do and evaluate clustering well. </p>

                        <strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong> I learnt how to use K-means to do clustering analysis on big datasets. For clustering analysis, use the scikit-learn tool in Python. Look at and understand the clustering data so you can make smart choices.</p>

                    <h2>Unit 7: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)</h2>
                    <p>Artificial brain Networks (ANNs) are the topic of Week 7. ANNs are an algorithm that is based on biological brain systems. ANNs can learn from their surroundings and change to make better decisions, just like the human brain. ANN is used in many areas, from marketing to automation. It is a key part of the ongoing Industry 4.0 revolution, in which machines make more and more choices with little help from humans.

The week's lessons look at the similarities between biological neurones and artificial neural networks (ANNs), which helps students learn more about the methods that make ANNs work. To help you understand how neural networks work, we also talk about some of the most important functions they use, like activation functions. Learners will be able to evaluate ANN critically, make simple ANN artefacts, and get involved with new study in this field by the end of this week.
</p>
                    <strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong> Critically understand the detailed workings of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Design and develop basic ANN artefacts. Emerging research on ANN and its applications.

                    <h2>Unit 8: Training an Artificial Neural Network</h2>
                    <p>This week we've talked about how Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) learn by adjusting weights to get better accuracy and minimising mistakes through backpropagation. Backpropagation sends mistakes backwards, which improves the model's estimates. The practical tasks are mostly about making ANN artefacts and using gradient descent to get the best results.

The readings also talk about how ANN can be used in business, like to automate customer service and find scams (Mach, 2021). They also warn about risks, like AI-generated content (Hutson, 2021). New study focusses on making AI decisions more open (Castelvecchi, 2016).</p>

                     <strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong> Understand ANN error handling via backpropagation. Develop and optimize ANN artefacts. Critically analyze emerging ANN research.

                    <h2>Unit 9: Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</h2>
                    <p>This unit talks about Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are a powerful type of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) that are commonly used in computer vision. CNNs help machines understand and analyse images, which is important in many fields, such as healthcare (e.g., medical imaging), transportation (e.g., self-driving cars), and agriculture (e.g., crop monitoring by drones). CNNs are a basic tool in machine learning for picture analysis because their algorithm makes it easier to find, group, and separate visual data.

This unit goes over in depth how CNN algorithms work, as well as the relevant Python libraries and real-world examples. By working on this unit, students will get better at simple computer vision tasks and understand how CNN applications can be used in real life. </p>

                    <strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong> Understand the application and importance of computer vision: Learners will grasp how CNNs are applied across industries, recognizing their value in automating tasks related to image and video processing.

Undertake basic computer vision tasks: Learners will develop the ability to implement basic CNN models, applying them to common computer vision problems such as image classification and object detection.
