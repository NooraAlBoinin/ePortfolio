      <li>Developed an actionable CPD plan aligned with my goals</li>
      <li>Explored industry-recognised certifications and e-Portfolio uses</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Unit 11 marked a turning point in consolidating my learning experience. I evaluated my development using the Professional Skills Matrix, then identified priority areas for further growth‚Äîsuch as mastering Power BI and strengthening quantitative analysis. I formalised these into an action plan that I intend to follow post-module.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also deepened my understanding of e-Portfolios as career tools. Beyond academic purposes, they offer a means to showcase competencies to potential employers or collaborators. My Learning Loop submission captures this reflective journey and outlines how I intend to apply these skills in practice.
    </p>

      <h2>Unit 12: Project Management and Managing Risk</h2>

    <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Explored project life cycles and core principles of project management</li>
      <li>Learned how to identify, assess, and manage risks and uncertainties</li>
      <li>Understood change control and its role in maintaining project quality</li>
      <li>Reflected on my development through the final e-Portfolio submission</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This final unit focused on practical aspects of project management. I studied how projects evolve across their life cycles, and how structured processes help in managing scope, time, cost, and change. The concept of risk as both a threat and an opportunity shifted my mindset toward a proactive, rather than reactive, project strategy.
    </p>

    <p>
      I submitted my complete e-Portfolio with a 1,000-word reflection that summarised my growth in applying research skills, working independently, and managing data ethically. It also included an updated action plan to support my continued professional development.
    </p>

    <h3>My Contributions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Submitted full e-Portfolio with artefacts and a final reflective piece</li>
      <li>Completed the Unit 12 Self-Test Quiz</li>
      <li>Provided feedback via the End-of-Module Survey</li>
