    <h2>Unit 1: Introduction to Research Methods. The Scientific Investigation and Ethics in Computing</h2>

    <p>Welcome to Week 1 in which you will be introduced to Research Methods as a subject. We will start with the Scientific Method and Ethics considerations in Research.</p>

    <p>The first question to answer in this module would be ‚ÄúWhat is the Purpose of Research?‚Äù. Whether you continue in Higher Education or move into industry, it is essential to understand why you carry out research. There are 3 main reasons/purposes of research: to explore (familiarise yourself with a topic/situation), to describe (describe your findings), and to explain (answer the question ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù) (QuestionPro, 2021).</p>

    <p>One of the most important approaches in research is the scientific method. See Andersen & Hepburn (2020) for details on the history of this method which involves observation, hypothesis, reasoning and testing. The combination of these elements can vary significantly depending on the discipline of a researcher.</p>

    <p>Our focus in this unit is on the types of reasoning used in the scientific method as these are the key approaches for problem-solving. The 2 core types of reasoning are Deductive and Inductive reasoning.</p>

    <h3>Deduction vs Induction</h3>
    <p>Both deduction and induction are forms of inference. Deduction moves you from an idea to an observation, while induction takes you from an observation to an idea.</p>

    <p>Deduction can yield a perfect conclusion if all assumptions are correct but is harder to use outside lab settings. Induction, on the other hand, is practical for solving everyday problems with partial information.</p>

    <h3>Ethics in Research</h3>
    <p>Before delving further into the research process, it is essential to develop an understanding of research ethics, especially when people are involved. According to the University of Essex Online's Ethics Submission Guidance:</p>

    <blockquote>
        Ethical approval must be granted before students can collect any data from external sources or undertake primary research with human participants...
    </blockquote>

    <p>As described by the Menlo Report (Finn & Shilton, 2023), key principles include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Respect:</strong> Participation must be voluntary and anonymous.</li>
        <li><strong>Beneficence:</strong> Maximise benefits while minimising risks.</li>
        <li><strong>Justice:</strong> Ensure fairness and equality.</li>
        <li><strong>Respect for Law and Public Interest:</strong> Ensure transparency, integrity, and legal compliance.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In the age of generative AI, ethical computing includes additional considerations (Deckard, 2023). The BCS Code of Conduct also offers guidance on professionalism, data protection, and intellectual property.</p>

    <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Differentiate between inductive and deductive reasoning.</li>
        <li>Understand the importance of ethics in research and professional practice.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Unit 5: Interviews, Survey Methods, and Questionnaire Design</h2>
<p>This unit introduced the foundations of <strong>agent communication</strong>, including the use of Speech Act Theory, communication languages like <code>KQML</code>, and the role of <strong>ontologies</strong> in meaningful message exchange. We discussed how agents express intent and interact within distributed systems.</p>
<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speech Acts:</strong> Understood performatives and how agents use them to ask, tell, and request.</li>
<li><strong>Communication Languages:</strong> Explored the design and purpose of ACLs like KQML.</li>
<li><strong>Ontology Use:</strong> Examined how shared vocabularies help agents avoid misinterpretation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Collaborative Discussion 2 Initial Post</h3>
<p>In this post, I discussed the benefits and challenges of using agent communication languages (ACLs) such as KQML. While ACLs enable agents to share intent and cooperate in open systems, they require consistent ontologies and are more complex to implement than traditional method calls.</p>

<h2>Final Reflection: Intelligent Agent Systems</h2>
<h3>WHAT?</h3>
<p>Throughout the Intelligent Agent Systems module, I engaged with a range of concepts that deepened my understanding of agent-based computing and its real-world applications. The module began by introducing foundational ideas around autonomous agents, such as reactivity, proactivity, and social ability, and evolved into complex applications using adaptive algorithms, agent architectures, and communication protocols. These concepts align with Russell and Norvig‚Äôs (2021) core principles of intelligent behaviour and decision-making.</p>
<p>My final project, ‚ÄúA Modular Multi-Agent AI System for Anomaly Detection in Fitbit Data,‚Äù synthesised this learning. I designed a multi-agent architecture where each agent had a clear, modular role‚Äîdata retrieval, validation, AI analysis, reporting, and security. This system detected anomalies in health data using an Isolation Forest model with PCA for interpretability. It was the culmination of iterative learning from each weekly unit, seminar task, and formative activity. By distributing roles across agents, the project reflected real-world scalable architectures, as described in Maes‚Äô (1991) work on agent networks.</p>
<p>Additionally, participating in Collaborative Discussions and completing activities like constituency-based parse trees, ethical evaluations of generative AI, and industry applications in FinTech and Industry 4.0 allowed me to apply theory to modern AI challenges. These tasks reinforced the importance of combining theoretical knowledge with reflective practice (Rolfe, Freshwater and Jasper, 2001; The University of Edinburgh, n.d.), enabling me to critically assess and adapt agent designs for practical use.</p>
<h3>SO WHAT?</h3>
<p>One pivotal moment in the development process came during the evaluation of our MAS architecture in Unit 6. Initial designs proposed a centralized model for data flow, but team feedback, particularly from Marwa and Abdulhakim, raised concerns about scalability and bottlenecks. In response, we collaboratively pivoted to a multi-agent architecture. This change, driven by peer critique, taught me the value of adaptive planning and iterative co-design‚Äîprinciples central to agile methodologies and intelligent system evolution (Tomasino, 2025). It also underscored the significance of early-stage design reviews as a safeguard against architectural rigidity in real-time systems.</p>
<p>Moreover, feedback on our project report pointed out the need for deeper justification of our AI model choices, particularly the selection of Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM. This critique prompted me to investigate model alternatives such as Autoencoders and DBSCAN, which I presented informally to the team. While we maintained our original choice for its real-time efficiency, this process helped me develop evaluative thinking and evidence-based reasoning‚Äîkey aspects of critical reflection as advocated by Rolfe et al. (2001). It made me more confident in defending design decisions using empirical performance metrics and theoretical fit.</p>
<p>Another area where peer insight shifted my approach was in addressing false positives during data validation. Originally, I underestimated this risk. However, Tala‚Äôs input led us to implement a forensic logging mechanism that flagged and reviewed anomalies before final reporting. This small but meaningful change reinforced the importance of continuous peer review and reflective responsiveness‚Äîskills I now see as essential in both technical and team-oriented AI projects. It also revealed how even minor feedback, when thoughtfully considered, can elevate the overall robustness and accountability of intelligent systems.</p>
<h3>NOW WHAT?</h3>
<p>Looking ahead, this module has laid a strong foundation for my future in AI and intelligent systems. I now feel confident in developing modular AI architectures and using libraries like Scikit-learn and NLTK to prototype agent systems. More importantly, I understand the value of structuring agents around autonomy and communication, inspired by Maes' (1991) agent network architecture and reinforced through the concepts introduced by Russell and Norvig (2021). I now view intelligent agents as components in distributed systems that can respond and adapt to uncertainty.</p>
<p>The challenges I faced taught me the importance of documenting design decisions and staying reflective throughout technical work. I plan to integrate structured journaling into future projects to track emotional and cognitive progress, especially when tackling new algorithms or team-based systems. This approach aligns with Rolfe et al.‚Äôs (2001) guidance on critical reflection as a continuous process of learning through experience.</p>
<p>My understanding of ethical AI has evolved, and I now approach problems with a broader perspective. I intend to pursue further reading on explainable AI (XAI) and SHAP interpretability methods, especially for health-related AI applications, where transparency is critical (Floridi, 2019). These methods can help mitigate biases and support trust in high-stakes decision-making environments.</p>
<p>In terms of transferable skills, this module strengthened my:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢	Time management ‚Äì by balancing readings, coding, discussions, and project work weekly.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢	Critical thinking ‚Äì by evaluating agent architectures and adaptive algorithms across sectors.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢	Technical communication ‚Äì through e-portfolio updates, annotated code, and peer feedback.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢	Ethical awareness ‚Äì through discussions of bias, privacy, and regulation in deep learning, reinforcing the need for value-sensitive design (University of Essex Online, n.d.).</p>
