    <h3>Learning Outcomes Achieved</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Differentiated between inductive and deductive reasoning</li>
      <li>Explored research ethics and professional standards</li>
      <li>Reflected critically on generative AI and ethical implications</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In Week 1, I explored the foundations of research, including its purpose‚Äîexploration, description, and explanation (QuestionPro, 2021)‚Äîand the scientific method (Anderson and Hepburn, 2020). I examined deductive reasoning (from general to specific) and inductive reasoning (from observation to theory), reinforced through the reasoning quiz.</p>

    <p>Ethics were introduced through the Menlo Report‚Äôs principles: Respect, Beneficence, Justice, and Respect for Law (Finn and Shilton, 2023). I also reflected on challenges in generative AI ethics (Deckard, 2023), linking them to current computing responsibilities.</p>

    <p>Professional expectations from the BCS Code of Conduct were reviewed and compared to ACM‚Äôs ethical guidelines during seminar activities and in my reflective writing.</p>

    <h3>My Contributions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Completed Reflective Activity on Generative AI Ethics</li>
      <li>Participated in Collaborative Discussion 1 and submitted a summary</li>
      <li>Attended Seminar 1 and reviewed module expectations</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Topic Selection</h3>
    <p>I selected <strong>‚ÄúPost-COVID Implementation of E-Learning in Primary Schools‚Äù</strong> from the approved list of topics (University of Essex Online, 2025), aligning with my interests in digital education reform.</p>

  <div class="inner"><h2>Unit 2: Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal</h2>

    <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Transformed a broad idea into a focused research question</li>
      <li>Explored the structure of a research proposal</li>
      <li>Learned to critically conduct and present a literature review</li>
      <li>Planned outlines for both the literature review and proposal</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This week focused on turning a research idea into a structured proposal, beginning with formulating a clear, researchable question. Boza (2022) highlights how defining a topic can feel overwhelming but is key to academic success. I used brainstorming and refinement strategies to shape my idea‚Äî<strong>‚ÄúPost-COVID Implementation of E-Learning in Primary Schools‚Äù</strong>‚Äîinto a focused inquiry.</p>

    <p>I explored how literature reviews provide critical insight into existing research, highlight gaps, and establish a theoretical foundation. Using guide questions and Moodle resources, I began planning my review by identifying relevant sources related to digital learning and Qatar‚Äôs education system.</p>

    <h3>My Contributions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Developed a research question and mapped it to proposal components</li>
      <li>Planned my literature review using guide prompts</li>
      <li>Linked my topic to the approved list from Unit 1</li>
      <li>Responded to peers in the Unit 1 discussion forum</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Unit 3: Methodology and Research Methods</h2>

    <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Understood key differences between qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods</li>
      <li>Explored primary vs. secondary data collection approaches</li>
      <li>Evaluated research designs including exploratory and descriptive methods</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This week focused on understanding how underlying assumptions shape research design and methodology. Saunders et al. (2023) introduced ontological, epistemological, and axiological assumptions that inform every researcher's approach. I explored exploratory and descriptive research design, learning how each supports different goals in framing a study (BRM, n.d.).</p>

    <p>I reviewed the characteristics and use cases of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research. I also reflected on primary and secondary data collection techniques and considered which align best with my own topic: <strong>Post-COVID Implementation of E-Learning in Primary Schools</strong>.</p>

    <p>As part of this unit‚Äôs seminar and portfolio activity, I analysed two academic papers using different research methods, evaluating the suitability of their methodologies, data collection, and the strength of their conclusions.</p>

    <h3>My Contributions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Completed the Research Proposal Review e-Portfolio activity</li>
      <li>Participated in Seminar 2 ‚Äì Peer Review of Research Papers</li>

<h2>Unit 5: Interviews, Survey Methods, and Questionnaire Design</h2>
<p>This unit introduced the foundations of <strong>agent communication</strong>, including the use of Speech Act Theory, communication languages like <code>KQML</code>, and the role of <strong>ontologies</strong> in meaningful message exchange. We discussed how agents express intent and interact within distributed systems.</p>
<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speech Acts:</strong> Understood performatives and how agents use them to ask, tell, and request.</li>
<li><strong>Communication Languages:</strong> Explored the design and purpose of ACLs like KQML.</li>
<li><strong>Ontology Use:</strong> Examined how shared vocabularies help agents avoid misinterpretation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Collaborative Discussion 2 Initial Post</h3>
<p>In this post, I discussed the benefits and challenges of using agent communication languages (ACLs) such as KQML. While ACLs enable agents to share intent and cooperate in open systems, they require consistent ontologies and are more complex to implement than traditional method calls.</p>

<h2>Final Reflection: Intelligent Agent Systems</h2>
<h3>WHAT?</h3>
<p>Throughout the Intelligent Agent Systems module, I engaged with a range of concepts that deepened my understanding of agent-based computing and its real-world applications. The module began by introducing foundational ideas around autonomous agents, such as reactivity, proactivity, and social ability, and evolved into complex applications using adaptive algorithms, agent architectures, and communication protocols. These concepts align with Russell and Norvig‚Äôs (2021) core principles of intelligent behaviour and decision-making.</p>
<p>My final project, ‚ÄúA Modular Multi-Agent AI System for Anomaly Detection in Fitbit Data,‚Äù synthesised this learning. I designed a multi-agent architecture where each agent had a clear, modular role‚Äîdata retrieval, validation, AI analysis, reporting, and security. This system detected anomalies in health data using an Isolation Forest model with PCA for interpretability. It was the culmination of iterative learning from each weekly unit, seminar task, and formative activity. By distributing roles across agents, the project reflected real-world scalable architectures, as described in Maes‚Äô (1991) work on agent networks.</p>
<p>Additionally, participating in Collaborative Discussions and completing activities like constituency-based parse trees, ethical evaluations of generative AI, and industry applications in FinTech and Industry 4.0 allowed me to apply theory to modern AI challenges. These tasks reinforced the importance of combining theoretical knowledge with reflective practice (Rolfe, Freshwater and Jasper, 2001; The University of Edinburgh, n.d.), enabling me to critically assess and adapt agent designs for practical use.</p>
<h3>SO WHAT?</h3>
<p>One pivotal moment in the development process came during the evaluation of our MAS architecture in Unit 6. Initial designs proposed a centralized model for data flow, but team feedback, particularly from Marwa and Abdulhakim, raised concerns about scalability and bottlenecks. In response, we collaboratively pivoted to a multi-agent architecture. This change, driven by peer critique, taught me the value of adaptive planning and iterative co-design‚Äîprinciples central to agile methodologies and intelligent system evolution (Tomasino, 2025). It also underscored the significance of early-stage design reviews as a safeguard against architectural rigidity in real-time systems.</p>
<p>Moreover, feedback on our project report pointed out the need for deeper justification of our AI model choices, particularly the selection of Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM. This critique prompted me to investigate model alternatives such as Autoencoders and DBSCAN, which I presented informally to the team. While we maintained our original choice for its real-time efficiency, this process helped me develop evaluative thinking and evidence-based reasoning‚Äîkey aspects of critical reflection as advocated by Rolfe et al. (2001). It made me more confident in defending design decisions using empirical performance metrics and theoretical fit.</p>
<p>Another area where peer insight shifted my approach was in addressing false positives during data validation. Originally, I underestimated this risk. However, Tala‚Äôs input led us to implement a forensic logging mechanism that flagged and reviewed anomalies before final reporting. This small but meaningful change reinforced the importance of continuous peer review and reflective responsiveness‚Äîskills I now see as essential in both technical and team-oriented AI projects. It also revealed how even minor feedback, when thoughtfully considered, can elevate the overall robustness and accountability of intelligent systems.</p>
<h3>NOW WHAT?</h3>
<p>Looking ahead, this module has laid a strong foundation for my future in AI and intelligent systems. I now feel confident in developing modular AI architectures and using libraries like Scikit-learn and NLTK to prototype agent systems. More importantly, I understand the value of structuring agents around autonomy and communication, inspired by Maes' (1991) agent network architecture and reinforced through the concepts introduced by Russell and Norvig (2021). I now view intelligent agents as components in distributed systems that can respond and adapt to uncertainty.</p>
<p>The challenges I faced taught me the importance of documenting design decisions and staying reflective throughout technical work. I plan to integrate structured journaling into future projects to track emotional and cognitive progress, especially when tackling new algorithms or team-based systems. This approach aligns with Rolfe et al.‚Äôs (2001) guidance on critical reflection as a continuous process of learning through experience.</p>
<p>My understanding of ethical AI has evolved, and I now approach problems with a broader perspective. I intend to pursue further reading on explainable AI (XAI) and SHAP interpretability methods, especially for health-related AI applications, where transparency is critical (Floridi, 2019). These methods can help mitigate biases and support trust in high-stakes decision-making environments.</p>
<p>In terms of transferable skills, this module strengthened my:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢	Time management ‚Äì by balancing readings, coding, discussions, and project work weekly.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢	Critical thinking ‚Äì by evaluating agent architectures and adaptive algorithms across sectors.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢	Technical communication ‚Äì through e-portfolio updates, annotated code, and peer feedback.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢	Ethical awareness ‚Äì through discussions of bias, privacy, and regulation in deep learning, reinforcing the need for value-sensitive design (University of Essex Online, n.d.).</p>
