  </ul>

  <p>Week 1 introduced core research principles—exploration, description, and explanation (QuestionPro, 2021)—and reasoning types (Anderson and Hepburn, 2020). The Menlo Report’s four principles shaped my understanding of ethics in computing (Finn and Shilton, 2023), which I applied in reflecting on generative AI’s risks (Deckard, 2023).</p>

  <p>I compared the BCS and ACM codes of conduct in seminar activities and developed my understanding of professional responsibility.</p>

  <h3>My Contributions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Submitted a reflective piece on AI ethics</li>
    <li>Completed Discussion 1 and seminar activity</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Topic Selection</h3>
  <p>I chose the topic <strong>“Post-COVID Implementation of E-Learning in Primary Schools”</strong> to align with my interest in digital learning reforms.</p>

    </ul>

    <p>
      Unit 11 marked a turning point in consolidating my learning experience. I evaluated my development using the Professional Skills Matrix, then identified priority areas for further growth—such as mastering Power BI and strengthening quantitative analysis. I formalised these into an action plan that I intend to follow post-module.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also deepened my understanding of e-Portfolios as career tools. Beyond academic purposes, they offer a means to showcase competencies to potential employers or collaborators. My Learning Loop submission captures this reflective journey and outlines how I intend to apply these skills in practice.
    </p>

      <h2>Unit 12: Project Management and Managing Risk</h2>

    <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Explored project life cycles and core principles of project management</li>
      <li>Learned how to identify, assess, and manage risks and uncertainties</li>
      <li>Understood change control and its role in maintaining project quality</li>
      <li>Reflected on my development through the final e-Portfolio submission</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This final unit focused on practical aspects of project management. I studied how projects evolve across their life cycles, and how structured processes help in managing scope, time, cost, and change. The concept of risk as both a threat and an opportunity shifted my mindset toward a proactive, rather than reactive, project strategy.
    </p>

    <p>
      I submitted my complete e-Portfolio with a 1,000-word reflection that summarised my growth in applying research skills, working independently, and managing data ethically. It also included an updated action plan to support my continued professional development.
    </p>

    <h3>My Contributions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Submitted full e-Portfolio with artefacts and a final reflective piece</li>
      <li>Completed the Unit 12 Self-Test Quiz</li>
      <li>Provided feedback via the End-of-Module Survey</li>
