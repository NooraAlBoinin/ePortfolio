      This unit served as a reflective milestone where I evaluated how my learning across the programme has contributed to my personal and professional growth. 
      I reviewed all previous units, finalised my Professional Skills Matrix, and developed an action plan identifying areas for future learning and skill development.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also reviewed the significance of e-Portfolios in professional environments. These not only serve as academic evidence but also as personal showcases for future employers and collaborators. 
      My Learning Loop submission captures the holistic nature of my development and outlines how I plan to apply these skills beyond the university context.

    <h2>Unit 12: Project Management and Managing Risk</h2>

    <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Explored core principles of project management and life cycles</li>
      <li>Learned how to identify, assess, and manage risks and uncertainties</li>
      <li>Understood the change control process and its role in maintaining quality</li>
      <li>Reflected on my learning journey through the final e-Portfolio submission</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This unit concluded the module with a focus on practical project management and risk mitigation. 
      I explored how projects evolve through life cycles and how managing change and uncertainty is essential to delivering successful outcomes. 
      The concept of risk as both a threat and an opportunity was particularly insightful, encouraging a more balanced view of project uncertainty.
    </p>

    <p>
      I finalised and submitted my full e-Portfolio including the 1,000-word reflective piece, which synthesises my development across the module.
      This final reflection highlights how my understanding of research, data, collaboration, and professionalism has evolved, and includes an action plan for ongoing professional development.
