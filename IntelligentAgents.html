<h2>Unit 5: Agent Communication</h2>
    <p>This unit introduced the foundations of <strong>agent communication</strong>, including the use of Speech Act Theory, communication languages like <code>KQML</code>, and the role of <strong>ontologies</strong> in meaningful message exchange. We discussed how agents express intent and interact within distributed systems.</p>

    <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Speech Acts:</strong> Understood performatives and how agents use them to ask, tell, and request.</li>
      <li><strong>Communication Languages:</strong> Explored the design and purpose of ACLs like KQML.</li>
      <li><strong>Ontology Use:</strong> Examined how shared vocabularies help agents avoid misinterpretation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Collaborative Discussion 2</h3>
    <p>In this post, I discussed the benefits and challenges of using agent communication languages (ACLs) such as KQML. While ACLs enable agents to share intent and cooperate in open systems, they require consistent ontologies and are more complex to implement than traditional method calls.</p>

      <h2>Final Reflection: Intelligent Agent Systems</h2>

        <h3>WHAT?</h3>
        <p>Throughout the Intelligent Agent Systems module, I engaged with a range of concepts that deepened my understanding of agent-based computing and its real-world applications. The module began by introducing foundational ideas around autonomous agents, such as reactivity, proactivity, and social ability, and evolved into complex applications using adaptive algorithms, agent architectures, and communication protocols. These concepts align with Russell and Norvig‚Äôs (2021) core principles of intelligent behaviour and decision-making.</p>

        <p>My final project, ‚ÄúA Modular Multi-Agent AI System for Anomaly Detection in Fitbit Data,‚Äù synthesised this learning. I designed a multi-agent architecture where each agent had a clear, modular role‚Äîdata retrieval, validation, AI analysis, reporting, and security. This system detected anomalies in health data using an Isolation Forest model with PCA for interpretability. It was the culmination of iterative learning from each weekly unit, seminar task, and formative activity. By distributing roles across agents, the project reflected real-world scalable architectures, as described in Maes‚Äô (1991) work on agent networks.</p>

        <p>Additionally, participating in Collaborative Discussions and completing activities like constituency-based parse trees, ethical evaluations of generative AI, and industry applications in FinTech and Industry 4.0 allowed me to apply theory to modern AI challenges. These tasks reinforced the importance of combining theoretical knowledge with reflective practice (Rolfe, Freshwater and Jasper, 2001; The University of Edinburgh, n.d.), enabling me to critically assess and adapt agent designs for practical use.</p>

        <h3>SO WHAT?</h3>
        <p>One pivotal moment in the development process came during the evaluation of our MAS architecture in Unit 6. Initial designs proposed a centralized model for data flow, but team feedback raised concerns about scalability and bottlenecks. In response, we collaboratively pivoted to a multi-agent architecture. This change, supported by agile principles, taught me the value of adaptive planning and iterative co-design‚Äîkey to intelligent system evolution (Tomasino, 2025).</p>

        <p>Tutor feedback on our project report also highlighted the need for deeper justification of our AI model choices, particularly Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM. This critique prompted me to evaluate alternatives like Autoencoders and DBSCAN. Although we retained the original models due to their real-time performance, this reflection deepened my evaluative thinking‚Äîan essential element of critical reflection (Rolfe et al., 2001).</p>

        <p>Another key improvement stemmed from addressing false positives in anomaly detection. While initially overlooked, the importance of validation clarity was raised in tutor feedback, prompting me to propose a forensic logging mechanism. This not only improved our model's reliability but reinforced the value of continuous feedback integration and reflective responsiveness (Floridi, 2019).</p>

        <h3>NOW WHAT?</h3>
        <p>This module has laid a strong foundation for my future in AI and intelligent systems. I now feel confident in developing modular agent architectures and using libraries like Scikit-learn and NLTK. Concepts from Russell and Norvig (2021) and Maes (1991) now inform how I approach autonomy and decision-making in distributed systems.</p>

        <p>The challenges I faced reinforced the importance of structured journaling and documentation, which I plan to integrate into future technical work. Ethical considerations now play a larger role in my thinking, particularly in high-stakes environments like healthcare. I intend to explore explainable AI methods (e.g., SHAP) to ensure models remain transparent and user-trustworthy (Floridi, 2019).</p>

        <p>In terms of transferable skills, I developed stronger time management, critical thinking, technical communication, and ethical awareness. As I look ahead, I aim to explore the use of intelligent agents in smart manufacturing and education, and ensure these systems remain accessible, inclusive, and socially responsible‚Äîprinciples core to value-sensitive design (University of Essex Online, n.d.).</p>
