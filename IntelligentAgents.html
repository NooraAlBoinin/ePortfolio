        <h2>Unit 11: Model Selection and Evaluation</h2>
        <p>Unit 11 focused on <strong>model selection</strong> and <strong>evaluation</strong>, two crucial steps in the machine learning workflow. Just as selecting the right tool for a task is important, choosing the right model for tasks like classification or prediction significantly impacts the model's accuracy and real-world applicability. This unit explored the process of selecting the appropriate model and evaluating its performance to enhance its usefulness.</p>

        <p>Key topics covered include how to choose models for specific tasks, assess their performance using various metrics, and improve them through optimization. Machine learning professionals can significantly enhance their models by systematically critiquing and refining model performance. Additionally, accountability and transparency are critical when deploying these models, especially in high-risk fields like autonomous vehicles or healthcare. Ensuring that decisions made by these models are understandable and justifiable is essential for maintaining trust in machine learning applications.</p>

        <h3>Assignment Brief: Neural Network Models for Object Recognition</h3>
        <p>This individual assignment required us to develop a 20-minute presentation that demonstrates the assignment activities and accounts for 40% of the final module mark. The topic was <strong>Neural Network Models for Object Recognition</strong>, a highly relevant area in machine learning, particularly in sectors like autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, and video surveillance. The core focus was on building a neural network using the <strong>CIFAR-10</strong> image dataset, which consists of 60,000 color images across 10 object categories, and assessing the model's performance. The assignment included several key components, such as:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Partitioning the CIFAR-10 dataset into training, validation, and test sets.</li>
            <li>Designing the neural network architecture, with a focus on convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.</li>
            <li>Choosing and applying activation functions like <strong>ReLU</strong> and using <strong>categorical cross-entropy</strong> as the loss function.</li>
            <li>Training the model over a specified number of epochs while tuning hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size.</li>
            <li>Evaluating the model‚Äôs accuracy and generalization using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The presentation required a thorough demonstration of the model‚Äôs architecture and performance, alongside critical reflections on the learning outcomes from the task. One of the major challenges was to prevent overfitting, which we addressed by implementing data augmentation techniques like horizontal flipping and rotation (as reflected in our slides). Accountability and transparency in model deployment were particularly important in this task, as models used in autonomous vehicles or healthcare must be thoroughly validated to avoid unintended outcomes. Clear communication of how models make decisions is key to building trust and ensuring ethical use in real-world applications.</p>

        <p>As of now, I have not yet received feedback from the tutor on the Unit 11 assignment. However, I am confident in the thoroughness of my analysis and look forward to constructive feedback to improve my understanding and application of model selection and evaluation techniques.</p>

<!-- Final Reflection Section -->

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
        <p>The lesson on machine learning has completely changed the way I think about things, from basic ideas to real-life examples. I didn't know much about machine learning at first, but now I'm comfortable with the different methods and how they affect my professional, social, and ethical life.</p>

        <h3>WHAT: Key Experiences and Learning Outcomes</h3>
        <p>Hands-on activities in this module helped me learn how AI and machine learning are changing businesses as part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Working on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for picture classification with the CIFAR-10 dataset was a key experience. This was my first time working with CNNs, and it was both hard and fun to try to make them work like real neural networks. I learnt a lot about machine learning by setting up neural layers, pooling layers, and backpropagation to make the model work better. The first results were good, but I later learnt that changing hyperparameters, like learning rates and epochs, was key to making the model work better (Miroslav, 2021).</p>
        <p>In a very sobering moment, the Boeing 737 Max crash case study showed how dangerous it is to have automated systems that don't work right. It also showed how important it is to test things thoroughly and fairly, especially in important fields like healthcare and aviation (Wall, 2019). Also, talking about AI bias and data privacy made me very aware of the unethical effects of badly chosen training data, especially in law enforcement and healthcare, where unfair results can have very bad effects.</p>

        <h3>SO WHAT: Interpretation and Impact</h3>
        <p>These events have had a huge impact on how I think about the moral, economic, and social effects of machine learning. It's become clear to me that fairness, transparency, and responsibility are just as important as accuracy in models. For example, the biassed datasets we used for our Unit 6 group project made me realise how easy it is for machine learning models to reinforce social biases if they are not used properly. As part of our project, I helped find and fix these kinds of flaws by preprocessing the data and choosing the right features. This made me more aware of the professional duties that come with using machine learning models (Schwab and Zahid, 2020).</p>
        <p>At first, I found it hard to understand how to use model evaluation measures like AUC and R¬≤, but as time went on, I realised how important they are for choosing and improving models. These measures make it possible to improve model performance in a structured way. The balance between not overfitting and making sure generalisation became clearer as I tried out different methods for adding to the data, like horizontal flipping and rotation, which we used in our project to stop overfitting (Miroslav, 2021).</p>
        <p>Working with others in groups was another important way to learn. Because I was in charge of Unit 11, I led the model review project. It was hard to manage a team that worked in different time zones, but it helped me improve my leadership and communication skills. To make sure that jobs were assigned correctly and deadlines were met, coordination and communication had to be clear. Peer feedback confirmed that the things I did to help organise the team and move the project forward were valued.</p>

        <h3>NOW WHAT: Future Applications and Growth</h3>
        <p>I'm going to use the things I learnt in this lesson on bigger and more complicated machine learning projects in the future. I want to learn more about unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning in particular because I think they have a lot of promise for real-time data analysis, especially in finance and healthcare. Another thing I'm working on is getting better at choosing models and judging them. In order to make models that are useful in the real world, I want to make sure that they are not only correct but also open, honest, and moral (Rolfe et al., 2001).</p>
        <p>When I use machine learning models, accountability and openness are now very important to me, especially in high-stakes situations like self-driving cars and face recognition systems. In all of my future projects, I will put fairness, explainability, and data security at the top of my list. For example, it is very important to make sure that models have clear ways of making decisions when they are used in situations that affect people's lives. The things I've learnt in this subject have given me the tools to approach future projects with a higher sense of ethics (Schwab and Zahid, 2020).</p>
        <p>The teamwork activities in this lesson have also been very helpful. Working with a team that is spread out can be hard, but it's important to use tools like Trello and Slack to keep track of tasks and talk to each other. I'm going to use these tools on future projects to make working together easier and make sure everyone is on the same page. I also know how important it is to have clear roles and tasks so that people don't mix up their work and everyone is held accountable within the team.</p>
        <p>Another important thing to remember is that we need to keep looking into the social duties of people who work with AI. Concerns about AI bias, data privacy, and the difficulties of following rules like GDPR have made me more aware of the legal and social aspects of my job. As my job in AI continues to grow, I will make sure that the machine learning systems I create are not only technically sound but also morally sound (Wall, 2019).</p>
        <p>Finally, I can say that this module has greatly improved my technical skills and professional knowledge. I feel ready to take on the challenges of the machine learning field because I have mastered difficult algorithms like CNNs and thought about the larger ethical aspects of AI. The things I've learnt in this module will definitely affect my future job, and I can't wait to use what I've learnt in real life.</p>
