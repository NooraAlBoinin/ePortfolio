        <h2>Unit 6: Clustering with Python</h2>
        <p>This week, I applied the <strong>K-means clustering</strong> method to real-world datasets using Python‚Äôs <em>scikit-learn</em> library. Building on the introduction to clustering from the previous week, we focused on how clustering analysis can be applied in real-world scenarios. The main topics covered were the application of Python libraries in K-means clustering and how clustering methods can solve complex problems within large datasets. Learners used <strong>scikit-learn</strong> to perform clustering analysis, select the appropriate tools, and interpret the results to derive meaningful insights.</p>

        <p>K-means clustering is a machine learning method used to group data points based on their similarities or recurring patterns. Python‚Äôs scikit-learn library simplifies the implementation of K-means by offering various tools that streamline the process (Miroslav, 2021). This week focused on developing the essential skills required to perform and evaluate clustering effectively.</p>

        
        <h3>Reflection on AI Bias</h3>
        <p>A critical challenge in clustering is the potential for bias in training data. If biased data is used, the clustering results can lead to unfair or inaccurate groupings, especially when applied in sensitive areas such as healthcare or law enforcement. For instance, biased data in healthcare can lead to unequal treatment recommendations, while in law enforcement, it can result in biased profiling of individuals. Understanding these risks emphasizes the need for ethical data handling and careful validation of clustering outcomes to prevent harm in real-world applications.</p>

<h3>Seminar Summary</h3>
<p>This seminar introduced the K-means clustering algorithm. We discussed its applications in real-world datasets, including how to select the optimal number of clusters and interpret clustering results. The session emphasized the importance of avoiding bias in the training data.</p>

        <h3>Group Work Brief</h3>
        <p>Our group worked collaboratively on the project titled, "Is the length of an Airbnb listing title correlated with its performance?" The project required us to analyze listing titles using K-means clustering to explore patterns and potential impacts on listing reviews. As part of this, my primary responsibility involved data pre-processing and feature selection, particularly preparing the dataset by counting the number of words in each title to evaluate its correlation with performance.</p>

        <p>One of the key strengths of our group was the friendly and cooperative nature of the team. We frequently held meetings to discuss our progress and divided tasks efficiently, which contributed to the success of the project. I was particularly glad to work with such a dedicated and collaborative team. Together, we overcame challenges such as refining our methodology, which was highlighted in our feedback, particularly the need to expand the analysis by considering alternative variables (e.g., pricing or location) (Group 1 Feedback, 2024). Despite these challenges, we were able to improve the project and present insightful visualizations.</p>

        <p>The feedback we received emphasized the need for deeper critical analysis, especially around the weak correlation identified between title length and listing performance. While the feedback highlighted areas for improvement, such as expanding our methods and clarifying our visualizations, it also commended our clear presentation and strong teamwork. Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of critical thinking and collaboration in machine learning projects.</p>

        <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I learned how to apply K-means clustering analysis to large datasets.</li>
            <li>I developed the ability to use the <strong>scikit-learn</strong> library in Python for clustering analysis.</li>
            <li>I gained experience in interpreting clustering results to make informed decisions.</li>
            <li>Enhanced my teamwork and collaboration skills, particularly in dividing responsibilities and communicating effectively with team members.</li>
            <li>Increased awareness of AI bias and the importance of ethical data handling in clustering tasks.</li>

    <div class="inner">
        <h2>Unit 11: Model Selection and Evaluation</h2>
        <p>Unit 11 focused on <strong>model selection</strong> and <strong>evaluation</strong>, two crucial steps in the machine learning workflow. Just as selecting the right tool for a task is important, choosing the right model for tasks like classification or prediction significantly impacts the model's accuracy and real-world applicability. This unit explored the process of selecting the appropriate model and evaluating its performance to enhance its usefulness.</p>

        <p>Key topics covered include how to choose models for specific tasks, assess their performance using various metrics, and improve them through optimization. Machine learning professionals can significantly enhance their models by systematically critiquing and refining model performance. Additionally, accountability and transparency are critical when deploying these models, especially in high-risk fields like autonomous vehicles or healthcare. Ensuring that decisions made by these models are understandable and justifiable is essential for maintaining trust in machine learning applications.</p>

        <h3>Assignment Brief: Neural Network Models for Object Recognition</h3>
        <p>This individual assignment required us to develop a 20-minute presentation that demonstrates the assignment activities and accounts for 40% of the final module mark. The topic was <strong>Neural Network Models for Object Recognition</strong>, a highly relevant area in machine learning, particularly in sectors like autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, and video surveillance. The core focus was on building a neural network using the <strong>CIFAR-10</strong> image dataset, which consists of 60,000 color images across 10 object categories, and assessing the model's performance. The assignment included several key components, such as:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Partitioning the CIFAR-10 dataset into training, validation, and test sets.</li>
            <li>Designing the neural network architecture, with a focus on convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.</li>
            <li>Choosing and applying activation functions like <strong>ReLU</strong> and using <strong>categorical cross-entropy</strong> as the loss function.</li>
            <li>Training the model over a specified number of epochs while tuning hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size.</li>
            <li>Evaluating the model‚Äôs accuracy and generalization using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The presentation required a thorough demonstration of the model‚Äôs architecture and performance, alongside critical reflections on the learning outcomes from the task. One of the major challenges was to prevent overfitting, which we addressed by implementing data augmentation techniques like horizontal flipping and rotation (as reflected in our slides). Accountability and transparency in model deployment were particularly important in this task, as models used in autonomous vehicles or healthcare must be thoroughly validated to avoid unintended outcomes. Clear communication of how models make decisions is key to building trust and ensuring ethical use in real-world applications.</p>

        <p>As of now, I have not yet received feedback from the tutor on the Unit 11 assignment. However, I am confident in the thoroughness of my analysis and look forward to constructive feedback to improve my understanding and application of model selection and evaluation techniques.</p>

<!-- Final Reflection Section -->
<section id="final-reflection" class="wrapper style2 fade-up">
    <div class="inner">
        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
        <p>The lesson on machine learning has completely changed the way I think about things, from basic ideas to real-life examples. I didn't know much about machine learning at first, but now I'm comfortable with the different methods and how they affect my professional, social, and ethical life.</p>

        <h3>WHAT: Key Experiences and Learning Outcomes</h3>
        <p>Hands-on activities in this module helped me learn how AI and machine learning are changing businesses as part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Working on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for picture classification with the CIFAR-10 dataset was a key experience. This was my first time working with CNNs, and it was both hard and fun to try to make them work like real neural networks. I learnt a lot about machine learning by setting up neural layers, pooling layers, and backpropagation to make the model work better. The first results were good, but I later learnt that changing hyperparameters, like learning rates and epochs, was key to making the model work better (Miroslav, 2021).</p>
        <p>In a very sobering moment, the Boeing 737 Max crash case study showed how dangerous it is to have automated systems that don't work right. It also showed how important it is to test things thoroughly and fairly, especially in important fields like healthcare and aviation (Wall, 2019). Also, talking about AI bias and data privacy made me very aware of the unethical effects of badly chosen training data, especially in law enforcement and healthcare, where unfair results can have very bad effects.</p>

        <h3>SO WHAT: Interpretation and Impact</h3>
        <p>These events have had a huge impact on how I think about the moral, economic, and social effects of machine learning. It's become clear to me that fairness, transparency, and responsibility are just as important as accuracy in models. For example, the biassed datasets we used for our Unit 6 group project made me realise how easy it is for machine learning models to reinforce social biases if they are not used properly. As part of our project, I helped find and fix these kinds of flaws by preprocessing the data and choosing the right features. This made me more aware of the professional duties that come with using machine learning models (Schwab and Zahid, 2020).</p>
        <p>At first, I found it hard to understand how to use model evaluation measures like AUC and R¬≤, but as time went on, I realised how important they are for choosing and improving models. These measures make it possible to improve model performance in a structured way. The balance between not overfitting and making sure generalisation became clearer as I tried out different methods for adding to the data, like horizontal flipping and rotation, which we used in our project to stop overfitting (Miroslav, 2021).</p>
        <p>Working with others in groups was another important way to learn. Because I was in charge of Unit 11, I led the model review project. It was hard to manage a team that worked in different time zones, but it helped me improve my leadership and communication skills. To make sure that jobs were assigned correctly and deadlines were met, coordination and communication had to be clear. Peer feedback confirmed that the things I did to help organise the team and move the project forward were valued.</p>

        <h3>NOW WHAT: Future Applications and Growth</h3>
        <p>I'm going to use the things I learnt in this lesson on bigger and more complicated machine learning projects in the future. I want to learn more about unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning in particular because I think they have a lot of promise for real-time data analysis, especially in finance and healthcare. Another thing I'm working on is getting better at choosing models and judging them. In order to make models that are useful in the real world, I want to make sure that they are not only correct but also open, honest, and moral (Rolfe et al., 2001).</p>
        <p>When I use machine learning models, accountability and openness are now very important to me, especially in high-stakes situations like self-driving cars and face recognition systems. In all of my future projects, I will put fairness, explainability, and data security at the top of my list. For example, it is very important to make sure that models have clear ways of making decisions when they are used in situations that affect people's lives. The things I've learnt in this subject have given me the tools to approach future projects with a higher sense of ethics (Schwab and Zahid, 2020).</p>
        <p>The teamwork activities in this lesson have also been very helpful. Working with a team that is spread out can be hard, but it's important to use tools like Trello and Slack to keep track of tasks and talk to each other. I'm going to use these tools on future projects to make working together easier and make sure everyone is on the same page. I also know how important it is to have clear roles and tasks so that people don't mix up their work and everyone is held accountable within the team.</p>
        <p>Another important thing to remember is that we need to keep looking into the social duties of people who work with AI. Concerns about AI bias, data privacy, and the difficulties of following rules like GDPR have made me more aware of the legal and social aspects of my job. As my job in AI continues to grow, I will make sure that the machine learning systems I create are not only technically sound but also morally sound (Wall, 2019).</p>
        <p>Finally, I can say that this module has greatly improved my technical skills and professional knowledge. I feel ready to take on the challenges of the machine learning field because I have mastered difficult algorithms like CNNs and thought about the larger ethical aspects of AI. The things I've learnt in this module will definitely affect my future job, and I can't wait to use what I've learnt in real life.</p>
