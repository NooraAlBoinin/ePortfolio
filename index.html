                    <h2>Unit 1: Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)</h2>
                    <p>This unit has defined what machine learning (ML) is and why it is relevant in today’s business and industry. I learned that big data and ML algorithms are used in self-driving banking and online recommendations. The topic covered the background of ML, its uses, and the potential of the technology particularly in Industry 4.0. Another key finding was the integration of big data, ML, and AI to enhance automation and decision making (Zhao and Li, 2018). For the proper use of ML, the following ethical questions must be answered: bias in decision making, and data privacy (Schwab and Zahid, 2020). I learned programming, statistics, and critical thinking because ML involves technical skills and ethical understanding. The unit concluded by revisiting some of the ML issues such as overfitting and bias and how to address them through data management, algorithm training, and model assessment (Miroslav, 2021). This subject helped me build a strong foundation for my future courses in ML and equipped me to face the challenges and opportunities of the field.</p>

                    <h2>Unit 2: Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
                    <p>In Unit 2, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was presented, and it was stressed that EDA is crucial for checking the reliability of data used in data science and AI projects. EDA is useful in confirming the quality of raw data, identifying inconsistencies, and identifying patterns that might not be easily recognizable to the stakeholders or data analysts. It is very useful in feature selection for machine learning models because the initial set of features may require modification after the analysis of the data set. The unit discussed the process of EDA including how to explore the features of the data, detect outliers, and visualize the data. At the end of this unit, the learner should be able to conduct basic EDA, preprocess data for machine learning, and appreciate the role of EDA in feature engineering for both supervised and unsupervised learning models (Miroslav, 2021).</p>
